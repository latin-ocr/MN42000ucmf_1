engulphed 111 1110 abyss. seih he made it his constant study to record
- all the eveutsinwlrich he wasengaged.” Theoperationscithefleetiu
which he served during two years are described by him in his letters
to Synnott and Patrick Trant—-thc former written in the commence-
ment 01 1620, 1110 other in 1621: both 01 which he published in
1601111110 Catholic history 01 which the second edition is now
presented tc the public.

This work is divided into four tomes: the first containing some gc-
neral notices of lrish history prior to the English invasion 3 calendars Ἴ
aud oatalogues of 1110 lrish saiuts3 the wonders 01 lreland, especially
Patriclr’s Purgatory, at Lough Derg. The second tome, besidesa

1588, and brings down the narrative 10 the general submission 01 the

Irish at the accession 01 dames Ι. Τ110 fourth tome contains the lrish
reign 01 that monarch to the parliament 01 1613. For his brief uo-

to written authorities ,· in the subsequeut history he was obliged, hc
says, to dcpend mainly on his own research, the confusion of the times
having prevented any Catholic from vmiting it.

Not many years after the publication of his history, he was deprived

sister Helen embarhed for Ireland, hut was drcwned on the voyage,
his father died at the great age of 100 years, and was buried 111 the
Franciscan church at Corunna3 his mother soon followed him, and was
buried iu the same tomh: there remaiued but one sister, Leonora, who
had taken the veil at a very early age, and with her, he tells us, he
long mourned for the death 01 his parents, and 01 the brother and sister,
who had accompanicd them iu their exile. ln the poem, dedicated to
the memory of hisfamily, suhjoined 10 this prefatae, he writes with such

’ feeling, that there can be little doubt he was an affectionate brother and

SOU.

In the year 1629 he published his “Decas Patriciana.” It was
the first 01 a series 01 1110 lives 01 Irish Saints which he contemplated.
