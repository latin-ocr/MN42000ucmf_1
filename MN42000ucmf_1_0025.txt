11111111 Father Oantwell, that he had a very exalted cstimate 11 the
historian's laurcls; and it is certain that bc must have collected the
materials 11 his history at a very early age. Α few biographical ,
sketches inserted in this history, 11111 written before it, apparently 111
some other work, hetray manifest signs 11 ajuvenile hand. Having
'completed his studies at Compcstella, tmder his preceptor, Father
Synmrott, Vendana, and Peter Mareilla, he was destined to serve 11 the
Spanish army, bnt his fortunes were for 1 moment clouded by a duel
in whielrhe was involved at Madnd, 11 revenge an insnlt offered to bis
nephew, Donald, who was killed on the 16111 11 July, 1618, Philip
evaded the search of the Spanish police by taking refuge at the French
ambassador’s: but he is found not long 11111 11 his post in the Spa-
nish navy, 1111111111,1619,11111111111111 Cadit a letter to Dermod
O’Sullivan, Donald's heir, consoling him for the death 11 his father,
and giving adetailed account 11 11 action 11 the Spanish ficet against
the Turhs, in which several lrislrmen, and ,among them Philip's only
surviving brother, Daniel, had 1111111. SIrortl'y after he wrote a short
letter to his preceptor, Father Synnott, from the same place, telling
him that, though bowed down with grief 111· the death 11 his father
and the O’Sullivau, he was still husily engaged in composing his Oa-
tholic history, which it was to be 1111111, he said, would be deficient in
many 11 the greces 11 history, as he had but few books on heard. Syn-
nott sent areply, euconraging his pupfl to persevero, He also sent
him some materiata, bnt with an intimation that he felt it impossible
to turn them to any account, as they were copious enough, but the
authors had not marked with precision the dates and localities. To
this Dou Philip aeplied, that he was at no loss in digesting his mate-
rials, as he had his information from persons who had been actually
engaged in tbe wars 11 Elizabetb. 111 the same letter he complains
“that it is not Ciceronic diction 1111111 eleganeies 11 Valla and 111-
nutius, that he is acquiring on board, but sea terms, novel and bar-
barens. The rear 11 cannen, invented by some evil genius 111 the de-
struction 11 man, was craslring on his ears. He was practising rather
at the svvord than at the pen. How few excel in one, much less in
