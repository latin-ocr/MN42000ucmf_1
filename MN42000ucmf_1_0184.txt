⁸ The women of Drcgheda distinguished themselves on other occasions,
Before the year 1610, there was 110 fixed place for Uatlrolic worship in the
town: the few priests who remained celebrated mass and administered the
sacramente in different places and at different hours. Iu that year the Fran-
ciscans opened a chapel, which was twice plundered before the year 1617. On
the first occasion all the vestments, chalices, &a were carried off, but all the
brothers escaped; on the second, Father Francis Helan (sic) a very old
priest, was seized at the foot of the altar after saping mass. The other friars
disappeared through secret posses known to themselves alone. When old
Father Francis was conducted a prisoner through the streete, the women rose,
rushed in crowds from all parts of the town, and, after a copious volley of
stones and other missiles, succeeded in resouing him. Deeming it, however,
more prudent to bow to the storm, for the sake of the people, he surrendered
himself, and was conducted the same day to Dublin, and brought in his friar’s
dress before the ohancessor, the Protestarrt Arohbishop of Dublin. The oap-
tain of the escort interceded for him, telling the whole history of the capture
and rescue and voluntary surrender, and protesting vehemently that he had
never been in so great danger of his life, as from these women cf Drogheda.
“ Haec risum moverunt simul et iram contra cives incitarunt: frater carceri
mancipatus est, et ibi sex mensibus detentus.’' This seizure was part of a ge.
neral plan for taking all the friars and priests, a false brother having promised
that he would insure its success. The Archbishop of Dublin, Eugene Mat.
thews, narrowly escaped on the same day. The house in which be was living
was searched, buthe, with another companion, stole out through the windows,
over the roofs of the neighbouring houses, and baffled the government priest-
hunters. The false brother afterwards confessed his crime, “ (tum magno
dolore a nobis per internuntium, veniam petiit et ut speramus in gratia mor-
ruusestss' Monoep‚p.18. “
