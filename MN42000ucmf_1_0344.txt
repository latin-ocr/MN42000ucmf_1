⁸ Forty Irish priests, exiled for 1110101111, lauded at Bourdeaux‚ about the
year 1600. They gave an account 01 the state 01 Ireland to Florimond Rai-
mond, which he published in his history 01 the heresies 01 the 16111 century.
They had no regular college at Bourdeaux until Anne 01 Austria established
one hy letters potentin 1654. Previously to that time, they had the 01101011
01 St. Eutropius, and casual revenues sufficient 101 the support of 40 priests
or stndents, who did not, however, live in community. Α singular event first
attracted the royal favor to them. During the troubles 01 Αο00 01 1101111011
regenoy, the King 01 Spain sent 5,000 lrish troops to aid the rebels (the
Ormists 01 Bourdeaux.) A detachment‚ under the command 01 (10100011
M‘Garthy and 0¹Scanlon‚ was advancing 10 Bourdeaux, when they were met
by the Rev. Cornelius O'Scanlon and Dermod M‘Uarthy, superiore of the
Irish ecclesiastical body in that city, and brothers respectively to the two (10-
lonels. The result 01 the interview was, that the uolonels resolved 1101 only
to stand neutral themselves, but to 010 their intluence with the other detach-
ments 01 their countrymen. Word was sent 10 Golonel Dillon and to another
commander in Perigord, who adopted the same course, and neither the pro-
1111101001 threats of the Spanish officers could induce them 10 light against the
Regent's troops. Anne rewarded this conduct by endowing the seminary,
“ Notice sur le seminaire college des Irlandais 0 Bourdeaux.¹'

† The Irish had 110 endowed seminary in Paris when our author was writ-
ing. Messingham, 10 the dedication prefixed to his “ Florilegium‚¹' published
1624, gives the following account of the liberality of John Lescalopier, Baron
01 St. Just, Chaucellcr 01 the Quaen 01 France, &a to the Irish clerical
exiles iu Paris: “ Memores quippe sumus, nos fidei, religionisque causd exu-
lantes et mediorum inopia obscuro satis in loco manentes, alumnorumque
paucitate incognitos, ad magnificam domurn ab ipso translatos, auctisque
mediis et alumnorum numero, ad communem notitiam deductos. Nobiscum
pro fide exulibus vivere, religiosissimo praesidi magnae erant deliciae: 00 eo
nsque se humiliavit, 01 qui inter primos supremae Galliarum curiae magnates
sedere solebat, postremus in exulum Hiberuorum mensat non 1010 accumbere
sit dignatus-deque seminario nobis fundando, annuisqne redditibus assig-
nandis (quod et re ipsd dudum prestitisset nisi morte praeoccupatus fuisset)
efferebat.'' When the studente had completed their studies he sent them to be
examinedby FatherBinet, S.J., provided them with clothes and money for
their journey to Ireland 3 and then conducted them to Gardinal 11011010,
Bishop 01 Paris, from whom they received the requisito testimonials.
