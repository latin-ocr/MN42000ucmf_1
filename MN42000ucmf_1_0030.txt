is frequently at varianae with that 01 the 1111111100, and other au-
thorities, but the discrepancies, generally, are not great, nor do they

completely as he expected, the difficulty which deterred Fatlrer Synnott
from writing. The materials from which he compiled were the oral
narratives 011110 eriles, or unconnected Mss. sketches, and in awar so
long, sc eventlul, conducted hy the impulses 01 different independent
chieftains, it would have been impossible for the most tenacioris memory
tc retain the exact dates or the snccession 01 facts. Still, 110111 the very
great number 01 facts verified in the notes, the impressicn, it is oonfidently
hoped, must be that those which rest on his authority alone, may be
received with as much credit as is ordinarily given 10 the word 01 any
single author, compiling from tlre narratives 01 one party in a revol -
tionary war.

One vast superiority this history possesses over all others 01 the
period, is its general fidelity. With all its defects, its goes nearer than

the only principles that must guida the historiari in his study 01 that
momentous period. Without asserting that all who opposed Elinabeth
were influenced solely by religion, and much less that none 01 thern
were so before the year 1600, he shews how the proscription 01 the
national ereed did, 110111 the very eommencement 01 Elirabeth's reign,
provoke the mass 01 the people 10 disaffection, and how futile were the
attempta to pervert them,

Besides the works already mentioned, the author, it is believed, drew

up an account 01 the state 01 lreland, which was presented 10 the King ’ ²

01 Spain by Flerence Conry, Archbislrop 01 Tuam. Whether he oom-
pleted any 01 the other worhs which he meditated, especially one on
astronomyr 10 which study he was partial, the Editor has not disco-
