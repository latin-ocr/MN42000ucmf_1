snoorn a student propose to himself to write the Ghurch History ot

the Irish Catholios since the Reformation, he would find that the ma-
terials for the chief part of that desirable work remain as they were

nearly a century ago, The research which has contributed, es-
pecially during the last ten years, so many original accessions, both
to profane and to mediaeval ecclesiastical history, has added hut- little

’ to the materials lor modern ecclesiastical history, which are contained in
the Hibernia Dominicana. Many valuahle manuscripts, and some
books almost as rare as manuscripts, which it appears the learned
author of that work-never saw, still await, and will amply repay the
cares of an editor. Itis true, the story of the Irish Catholics has
been so fertile a theme for orntors, pamphleteers, aud historiens,
that a library might be stoched with works, written during the last
severity years, on that subject alone, These compilaticns how-
ever, principally regard Catholics in their relations to the civil power ,-
they record the ediets of the persecutors, bnt seldour introducens to
the private history of the catacomhs 3 and closely though the religions
and political history of the Irish people has been burded, yon will
often search in vein in all these works for the first elements of eccle·
siastical history3 the lives and successiou of the prelates in the diffe-
rent secs5 a consecutive history of the religious ordcrs; the means by
whieh the elergy were recruited and supported5 the places of public
worship3 the biography of eminent ecclesiastics3 the various pians de.
wised by fanaticism to eradicate the Catholic saith 3 and many other
topics which'belong exclusively to ecclesiastical history.
